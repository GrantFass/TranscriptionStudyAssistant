# [Sprint Goal](https://gitlab.com/msoe.edu/sdl/y23-senior-design/24-transcription-study-assistant/-/milestones/4#tab-issues): 
***Goal:***  
Hardware: Have main electrical components ordered, have 3d model of base shell, and have custom board designed.  
ML: Collect the transcript dataset, and touch up preprocessing  
Software: Finish prototyping and finish planning for main software device.

# Discussion:
## Meetings:
Weekly Meeting Notes:
- so6 look at what is being done software vs hardware and group accordingly. Can have the hardware and software teams each share their response to the SO objective.
- so3 has no deliverable other than the normal survey.
- so7 follow up to the so7-3 from last quarter. Explain how you went out and got the knowledge that you said you needed from last time. 
- week 8 is the next end of sprint
- so4-3 requires looking up the ACM code of ethics. pick one sub item for each of the three categories and address how you personally worked towards it. Three paragraphs total.
- need to fill out the student project show abstract next sprint
- presentation will need to be filled out next sprint
- software engineering team components is just an update tot he document from last quarter
- so2-1 quality analysis is a simple SO. the quality attributes example link is in week 4 modules. 
- Talk with Dr. Taylor about senior design lockers / storage.

Friday Meeting Notes:  
- 1 hour meeting
- Team filled out the KSS portion of the retrospective
- Team planned out and discussed what issues they would like to pursue for next sprint
  - Khan academy transfer learning issue to improve transformer performance. One 7pt investigation + one 7pt training issue.
  - Solder pins onto the dev board and the motor controller for 3pts
  - build and wire up the prototype for 7pts
  - implement the website gui features. Broken up by category of endpoints. probably 7pts per overall endpoint category. Only 2 go into this sprint
  - Design 3d model of test bench and print for 7pts
  - refine the 3d models of the electircal components with more exact caliper measurements for 5pts
  - the nodered issue for 7pts may be optional?
  - the ml backend issue for 7pts to do the ml endpoints of the API?
  - so objectives.
