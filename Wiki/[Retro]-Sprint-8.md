## Things to Keep:
- Weekly student meetings.

## Things to Stop:
- using languages that have a high learning curve, thus making it difficult for others to assist with issues.

## Things to Start:
- Need better communication for delayed and stalled issues. Communicate what is blocking you as well as weekly progress. Communicate faster on teams instead of once per week.
- Setting up issues so that more than one person can take them.
