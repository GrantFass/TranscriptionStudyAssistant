## Things to Keep:
- Keeping an added meeting midweek when possible.
- Budgeting time for sprint planning / retro.
## Things to Stop:
- Overcommitting to issues and volunteering for too many issues. Quality over quantity.
- Walls of text in wiki pages and too many headers on extended documents. Start using dropdowns.
## Things to Start:
- Start doing breakout meetings where certain teammates can set up meetings and work together instead of needing the full team.
- Breaking down our issues even more.
- Documenting Issue Progress Better.
- Record issue information straight to wiki instead of directly on issues.
