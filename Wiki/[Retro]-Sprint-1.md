## Things to Keep:
- Having the Tuesday meetings.
- Keep documenting progress in the issues with comments.
- Keep updating each other in the Teams students chat
- Keep updating the wiki. Posting the temp investigation pages is good so others can see it.
## Things to Stop:
- stop creating subtasks under issues since they make issues too big to track progress effectively.
## Things to Start:
- make each subtask its own task with its own point value
- Communicate progress better so issues stay more in scope
- May want to do the Friday meeting as a dedicated work time. Try to find another meeting time that is more ahead of time than the day before sprint end.
- Think more about what is involved in an issue so that we can point them better.
