# Sprint 1 Planning Feedback
- Perhaps there is a lot of detail on the subtasks, but it makes more sense noting that they are individual tasks.
- Sometimes we do not know as we start a sprint exactly what an issue may entail. So we may want to include a subtask for unknowns.
- Perhaps include a weight on subtasks in the future.
- add acceptability criteria for the main tasks.
- add acceptability criteria for subtasks as the sprint progresses.
- Assign the overall tasks before the sprint (who owns the overall issue). Subtasks can still be taken by others as needed.
- list scrum master, project manager, total story points in previous sprints.
- add in time to plan for next sprint and assignments as part of this sprint. 
  - do not need a lot of detail, just include times.
- Tasks should be priority ordered and there should be a disclaimer at the top of the plan.
- Should also have a summary of the issue under the individual task.
- rename value gained to business value possibly.
