# Project
## Other thoughts about the project
- look at passing in keywords to the text and seeing what it correlates
- look into ocr options for image text scanning such as tessaract

## Meeting
- we have an elevator pitch to do at some point
  - we will be recording the elevator pitch and posting it to canvas
  - should be no more than 30 seconds
  - Individual assignment
- need to put the meeting notes into the gitlab at some point
- status reports are only added to the wiki and do not need to be converted to pdf files.
- Project Proposal Feedback
  - the proposal does not need to be approved. The alternate project is just as a backup for just in case.
  - should clearly separate stretch goals.
  - explain more about what building the dataset entails
  - add more detail under the projected hardware requirements for project technologies
    - should have a detailed reasoning about what components are being used and why.
    - ex: what pcb, what microprocessor options, pros and cons, choice, etc.
    - possibly a little bit of funding available from the EE department. ***Waiting on Email Follow Up***
  - secondary proposal is fine.
  - device ideas
    - a device that follows the instructor and has directional audio so that the audio is still good as the instructor walks around. Look at an owl-camera.
      - if the owl is what we want. then we would not necessarily be prohibited from doing it but we need to have rational behind our decision to do this.
      - should look at lapel mics and other solutions and talk with other professors about what they would like from such a device.
      - customer discovery survey... ask what teacher and students issues are.
      - remember that sprints are 150 hours of work.
- will need to send out a formal email asking for video and lecture transcripts
- start sprint one Wednesday of next week.
- Sprint 1 plan, tech report, and status report W3 are due on Tuesday of week 3.
- have presentation (preparing, giving, attending others) during the week 10 of quarters.
- finals and break week would not count for the sprint durations.
- sprint prep performance are not due at all.
