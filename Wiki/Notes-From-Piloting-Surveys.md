# Student Surveys
Had 7 people pilot the survey

- Change the RCAS question wording (asked if they have used RCAS services instead of worked with RCAS)
- The wording for a few of the study questions (Wording for the most likely to use study question)
- Provide description that the supplementary materials are generated after the transcript is generated
- Some professors may not want this device in the classroom
- Factor in how easy it is to use
- Good job phrasing things to be neutral
- More detailed description in the beginning
- Have the description on each page
- Helps Freshman more -> may not be that helpful during labs
- Distinguish between rhetorical question and actual professor/student questions

# Instructor Surveys
- The description was detailed enough to get the main idea of the product (this description was changed after the student feedback was given)
- Questions were not confusing
- The survey wasn't too long or too short
- No changes need to be made
