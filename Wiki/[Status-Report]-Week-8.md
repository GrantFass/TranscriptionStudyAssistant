# Discussion:
## Meetings:
- Weekly Meeting
  - may want to allow for both built in microphones and lapel microphones.
    - if we use the lapel microphone we may be able to track the instructor through the location somehow (rfid?)
  - may want to prototype different designs
  - need to record down in a wiki page why we picked certain designs (and put in tech report)
  - do we want an on board battery for the device as a battery backup.
  - video passthrough for screenshare? (button on lapel microphone to toggle without walking back to computer?)
  - record the screenshare and the video feed and in post processing figure out what to show (both if needed).
- October 21st 2022
