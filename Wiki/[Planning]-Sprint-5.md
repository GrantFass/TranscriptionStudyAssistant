***Issue Summary:*** Create a pipeline to grid search a relevant hyperparameter space for the transformers. Possibly investigate multiple transformer types. This will require comparing the summaries with the text. A Khan Academy dataset may be useful for this. This search process should probably be run on the DGX nodes of ROSIE using slurm batch run. Perhaps send an email to Dr. Retert to make sure that there are no scheduled downtimes or big projects coming up that would be interrupted. Doing this over a break would likely be a good option.

***Business Value Gained:*** This lets us train our transformers to get the best possible performance.

### [Create 3D Assembly of Device Base](#110)
<details open><summary></summary>

***Story Points:*** $`7`$  

***Issue Summary:*** The main goal of this issue is to create a 3d assembly for the base of the device. This should be a proper 3d model created in solidworks or Autodesk inventor. The 3d model should be uploaded to the repo. Proper constraints should be used in the model so that the parts are not free floating. This means that everything should be constrained in all dimensions so it is fixed. IE: constrain touching surfaces so they are flush and constrain along the center axes of holes. Ask Grant if you have any questions about this process. This assembly file should contain models for most of the electronics (rough shapes are fine as long as holes are exact. Talk to Grant if you need a Caliper). It should also include the assembled device shell. It should likely include the main motor for rotation as well. Make sure that thermals and dust are considered. 

***Business Value Gained:*** This lets us create a full 3d model of our device so we can determine how it is assembled. This also lets us identify where there may be undue wear or structural weakness. We can also animate this model for our presentations as required.

***Acceptance Criteria:***  
- [ ] create a 3d assembly for the base of the device
- [ ] Solidworks or preferably Autodesk Inventor are used
- [ ] The model is uploaded to the repo
- [ ] Every part is properly constrained in the right locations so it does not move

</details>

### [Create 3D Models of Device Camera Shell Components](#112)
<details open><summary></summary>

***Story Points:*** $`7`$  

***Issue Summary:*** The main goal of this issue is to create 3d models (or just a 3d model) for the rotating camera pole of the device. This will let us print it by exporting it to a stl later. The model should be uploaded to the repo. This pole will be set on top of the base and connected to the motor in the base. This part needs to be designed to be stable when rotating on the base. Additionally it should not disconnect when the device is flipped upside down. Wires should be able to be run down the center of the column or along one of the outer edges. There should be space to mount the camera (and optionally the microphone if it is not in the base) on the device.

***Business Value Gained:*** This lets us model the camera pole for the device so we can print and assemble it later.

***Acceptance Criteria:***  
- [ ] Create a 3d model of the camera tower for the device
- [ ] Model is created in Solidworks or preferably Autodesk Inventor
- [ ] The models are uploaded to the repo (not their stl versions)
- [ ] Camera must fit
- [ ] How wires will be run is taken into account
- [ ] How this connects to the base is taken into account
- [ ] Should be stable on the base and not disconnect on flipping the device.
- [ ] There should be some way to easily disconnect the wires going between the base of the device and the camera area.

- [ ] Solidworks or preferably Autodesk Inventor are used
- [ ] The model is uploaded to the repo
- [ ] Every part is properly constrained in the right locations so it does not move
