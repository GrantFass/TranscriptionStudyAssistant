# Changes To Make
- Break some questions apart and use display logic to skip questions
- Provide an 'unsure' option instead of just a 'no preference' option

# Questions To Add
- Ask about specific classes this product could apply to
  - For example, math courses, freshman courses, etc.
- For the students, ask about year, major, and if they have worked with RCAS (if they had any barriers accessing resources)
- May ask the following question if we find that we would need to:
  - Do you consider yourself to be neurodivergent?
    - Yes
    - No
    - Prefer not to say

# Suggestions
- Export the results as csv
- Send out week 1 or later in the quarter
- Use word of mouth or posters for students
- Ask Dr. Sohoni to email program directors to get the survey out to as many teachers as possible
- Before sending out, pilot the surveys with instructors and students
- The free account has a limit of 500 responses per user limit, so we may need to ask for a paid account
  - Can ask Dr. Sohoni to reach out to Jill Meyer regarding getting access to a paid account (Dr. Panciera can be the approver for this)
