### Weekly Summary:
Still waiting for the Sprint to officially start. Met on Friday for a hour to draft the Sprint Plan with the group and today to finalize the plan for about an hour with the group. I additionally performed some research (3 hours) around what databases to use, some minimal security research, and began thinking of some very basic software infrastructure possibilities. I felt like I accomplished a lot more and I am super looking forward to this sprint! :)
