## Meetings:
Weekly Meeting Notes:
- Currently the 'survey' which has been renamed to a 'poll' is out and getting responses.
- Remember status report is due the night before.
- Week 10 status report is not due at all but still going to create it for our own records.
- Final presentations: even with only 9/20 of responses we currently have no full half hour blocks available.
- Other presentation times for other groups will be shared, attend if you want.
- How do peer reviews work: some members of each team can make some of the other presentations. Need to make at least one other time.
- for the presentation we should add pictures of the OWL device on the slide with the price. We should gray out software requirements that we may not be able to complete. We should fix the website contrast. Show either the site images or the demo. Fix the ML example output to show old model output vs new model output with an animation.
- 30 min meeting

Friday Meeting Notes:
- Nick: implemented the transformer prediction class. Downloaded some more of the Dr. Sohoni teams transcripts
- Teresa: Worked on #129. Adding account deletion button.
- Angela: working on camera issue. Got past the stalling issue but now there is an issue with a lock. Met with Xander and Nick on the amplifier and regulator. Made a decision on the amplifier. Getting 2 of those and can mount them inside the device so we do not need to modify the board. Xander is looking a bit more into regulators. Try using 3.3v for directional mic. May move on to motor issue then double back.
- Grant: worked on some node embeddings and graph ml related stuff so far.
- 15m meeting
