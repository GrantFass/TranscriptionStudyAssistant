### Weekly Summary: 
- This week I discussed project ideas with team members and spent a good portion of the time thinking about a possible hardware component that could be included in the Transcription Study Assistant project. I also added a few points to the project proposal, which included hardware requirements for the Transcription Study Assistant project, general project goals, and some software requirements for the Webcam Gesture Control project.

### Weekly Summary:
- This week I ended up working through a lot of the setup for the project and this quarter. This started with some of the meetings that we held before school started which are not included in my hour contribution for the first week. In these meetings we discussed some of our project ideas and narrowed them down to two choices. In our week 1 meeting we discussed what to do with these choices. I took notes during each of these meetings and sometimes set up agendas before the meetings and took notes during them. After the week 1 meeting I helped to coordinate the naming of the project for the repo. I also helped set up and draft much of the project proposal, as well as setting up the status report for week 2.

### Weekly Summary: 
- This week was mainly meetings and initial structuring and planning of the GitLab page. My main contribution this week was just showing up to the meetings which were only an hour or so. The rest of the time I spent was really just brainstorming and kind of mentally preparing for work to begin on the project. Nothing I can really explicitly show / write down yet, so I hope to have more in the coming weeks.

# Discussion:
We held three meetings as a team so far before this first status report.
1. helped to narrow down our project options from 10 ideas to 3 main ones.
2. Met with Dr. Sohoni to discuss our 3 main ideas. This resulted in narrowing the ideas down to 2, as well as answering questions about the process.
3. This meeting occurred during week 1 of fall term and rehashed much of the last meeting. 

There are no key findings or successes this week as the project has not been started yet.

# Advisor Questions:
We do not have any questions for the advisor at this time.

# Conclusion
There is no notable progress toward the sprint goal during this week as the project has not started and there is no active milestone.
