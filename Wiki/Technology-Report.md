[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction
This document has been split into multiple smaller sub-documents. This was done in order to improve the legibility and clarity of the document. This was also done due to the overall length of the documentation. By splitting the Technology Report into sub-documents we are able to focus on individual needs and requirements. The [Technology Report Requirements Page](https://csse.msoe.us/srdsgn/techreport/) specifies that for each choice there should be a list of potential options, a set of evaluation strategies, a choice, rationale for that choice, and prototypes to assist with that choice. Each of the smaller [Justification] sub-documents contain all of these sub-sections.
