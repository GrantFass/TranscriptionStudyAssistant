# Advisor Questions:
- Does the updated version of the sprint 3 planning document show a format that would be acceptable going forward?
- Can we look through and get thoughts on the API Communication Protocol document?
- Can we look through and get throughs on the Software Engineering Team Components Document?
- Can you explain the points deduction for the Sprint Prep Performance assignment so we can improve in the future?
- Can you explain the points deduction for the Sprint 1 Performance assignment as there is no rubric?

# Conclusion
Spent time working towards various hardware milestones and assignments due for senior design. Due to it being week 10, and many of us having presentations in other classes keeping us busy, our hours for this week are a little bit lower than expected. This should not pose a problem due to the extra time allocated during finals week and break week.
