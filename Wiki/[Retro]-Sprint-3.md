## Notable Issues Pointed Incorrectly:
- Biggest issue that was pointed wrong was #87 for the End-Of-Quarter Presentation. This issue was pointed for $2$ points but expected the presentation to be practiced and then presented as an entire team. As such this issue encompassed about $2$ hours per team member for practicing then another $2$ hours per team member for giving the presentations. This issue also included time spent alone practicing presentation sections as well as some time revising the presentation. As such this issue should have been pointed closer to $20$ points or perhaps as high as $25$.
- Sprint 3 Retro #85 was also pointed wrong. This issue neglects to take into account time spent as a team on the issue and thus should be pointed a bit higher to account for this. It is currently pointed at $1$. Assuming that about $30$ min is spent in an all team meeting on this and about $30$ min of planning that puts this issue around $3$ hours.
- Team Components Document #90 was estimated at $5$ but took just over $6$. This is because it did not account for time spent to review and revise the document.
- #89 for SO3-4 was not time tracked correctly
- #80 meet with dr. Panciera was underbudget by $1$ hour.
- #57 the camera hardware issue was overbudget by $2$ hours. 
- #86 sprint planning ended up taking almost 8 hours by the time the all team meeting hours were included. Only 3 hours were budgeted.
- QT / Angular
- Currently do not have any points in the sprint to track the all-team meetings. Both with, and without, the advisor present. Unsure if it would be useful to add in meeting tracking points since it may just end up being unnecessary time logging and our total sprint points per person already takes into account 2 hours per week per person for all team meetings.

## Things to Keep:
- Weekly student meetings are useful

## Things to Stop:
- Giant 20 point issues.

## Things to Start:
- Create smaller investigation issues first to determine scope of issues to avoid large point issues.
- Document issue progress as soon as possible (time logging and comments for progress)
