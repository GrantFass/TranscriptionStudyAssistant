## Non-Functional Requirements
This section details some of the system attributes such as security, reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability. These are loosely related to the [12 quality attributes in software architecture](https://syndicode.com/blog/12-software-architecture-quality-attributes/).
- Backend must be well documented to improve maintainability
- Endpoints must return a response in 250ms or less where possible to avoid angering users.
- Hardware to device communication must be secure
- Messages sent to and from the backend must be secure and encrypted
- Database access credentials MUST NOT be pushed to git and should instead be stored in a .env file.
- Backend must be scalable to accommodate more users over time.
