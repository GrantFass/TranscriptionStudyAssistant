# Proposal Discussions
As we discuss the various proposals, we should make sure to touch upon the following points. EE / CE may not need the hardware component. Waiting on follow up.
- Interest: How interested are people to do the project overall?
- Technological Feasibility: How feasible is it technologically to create the product in question?
- Monetary Feasibility: How feasible is it to create create the project fund-wise?
- Difficulty: How difficult do we think this product will be to create? Do we think we could take the entire year to make this?
- Inclusivity: Would everyone have something to do?
- Meets Requirements: Are each major's requirements met?

# Suggested Proposals
1. Webcam gesture control
  - Idea is to be able to control your computer using all gesture controls.
  - Would want the controls to be intuitive and easy to use.
  - May want a local device with a web camera built in that did all of the processing on its own so the camera was not web connected. Or determine what the gestures are through remote software.
  - Would target windows primarily with linux and android as stretch goals.
  - Thoughts:
    - Associate an app or software with it that would probably need a UI or something.
2. ~~SLS dye printer~~
  - ~~Out of scale for a Sr. design project and has too much of a mechanical aspect.~~
3. Memorization and note taking device
- Idea is to be able to let students focus more on listening to lectures than on writing notes.
- Some instructors prefer to teach at a fast pace so students who like to write down a lot of information to study later end up struggling. 
- Want to begin by creating a proof of concept device that would have an on board microphone to generate a transcript of what was said during the lecture.
- Questions:
  - Teams does transcription and so do other things.
  - Could use an already available transcription program then take the results and customize it for the user.
  - It is probably doable and also useful.
  - Instructors could help figure out human input interactions
  - Could serve as a useful tool for a professor. Can compare their key points
  - Can look through and have students say where they started to lose focus.
  - Could help identify tangents and unrelated topics in lectures that detract from the main goal.
  - Include video component to analyze white boards as well
- Hardware component ideas:
  - ?

Team & professor work together to determine what time of the week to meet. All the meetings would be held over teams. Need to figure out a new time each term. Do a whenisgood survey probably. Fill it out by Sunday night. Should be sent out by Thursday night.

Each sprint ends the night before the weekly meeting. Sprint plan for first sprint is due in week 2.

Canvas shell should be ready soon. 

Project idea and planning done by week 2. Week one is the last chance to change any idea.

Sr. Design is an educational experience. Grade does not depend on if the project works or not. Just need to demonstrate that you are learning from the project. If the project is really not working after a few weeks there is room to change projects.
